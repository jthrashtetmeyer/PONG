# PONG
This is the game Pong. It's my first project that I've made on my own without a tutorial. I'm using it to learn Python and Pygame. Stuff I still need to figure out: the movement of the ball as it bounces off the player paddles needs more complexity. Right now, it just bounces off with an x velocity of 5. I would like to code it so that the angle is different depending on where on the paddle it bounces. This will make the game more fun and complex. Finally, the most important thing is that this code is probably not that organized or easily readable by anyone other than me because I have too much in my main function. Anyway, I'm aware of these issues. The important thing is that it runs.
