# PONG
This is the game Pong. It's my first project that I've made on my own without a tutorial. I'm using it to learn Python and Pygame. Stuff I still need to figure out: the movement of the ball as it bounces off the player paddles needs more complexity. Right now, it just bounces off with an x velocity of 5. I would like to code it so that the angle is different depending on where on the paddle it bounces. This will make the game more fun and complex. 

Perhaps more imporantly as this project is intended to be a learning opportunity, I'm still learning how to best organize my code and make it as functional as possible. Right now the main function is very long. This makes the code hard to read, I know that. I'll continue to make the code more functional so the main function is as short as possible. My goal is to make the main function so short that it can be read without scrolling.
